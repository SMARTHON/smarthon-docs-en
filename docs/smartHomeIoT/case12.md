## Goal
<HR>

Make a smart colorful light that will change colors upon remote control app.


## Background
<HR>

<span id="subtitle">What is Smart Colorful Light?</span><BR><P>
A smart colorful light is a multi-color LED light that allows switching color of light, usually being requested through remote control, for example a mobile app. The user can adjust the color based on different needs. For instance, the user might need dark light when he/she is sleeping, baby feel comfortable when the room in warm color, and user may pick a good color when he/she is reading the book.
<BR><P>
<span id="subtitle">Smart Colorful Light Principle</span><BR><P>
The micro:bit will connect to the Internet to get the device ID. In the mobile app, it will send the different color command name to the micro:bit. In the micro:bit program, when it receives the command, it will show the corresponding color based on the command name.<BR><P>

## Hardware connect
<HR>

1. Connect the Multi-color LED (WS2812) to P0
2. Pull up the buzzer switch to disconnect the buzzer

## Programming (MakeCode)
<HR>

<span id="subtitle">Step 1. Initialize OLED, IoT:bit and connect to WiFi, initialize the Multi-color LED</span><BR><P>
* Snap `Initialize OLED with width:128, height: 64` to `on start`
* Snap `Initialize IoT:bit TX P16 RX P8` from `IoT:bit` to `on start`
* Snap `Set Wi-Fi to ssid pwd` from `IoT:bit`
* Enter your Wi-Fi name and password. Here we set `smarthon` as `SSID` and `12345678` as `password`
* Snap `set strip to NeoPixel at pin P0 with 1 leds as RGB(GRB format)` from Neopixel
![pic_60](images/Case12/Case12_p1.png)<P>

<span id="subtitle">Step 2. Show icon “tick” and Device ID after WiFi connection</span><BR><P>
* Snap `show icon` from `basic` to `On WiFi connected` and select icon `tick`
* Draw the `Device ID` variable from `On WiFi connected` to the `show string` block placeholder
![pic_50](images/Case12/Case12_p2.png)<P>

<span id="subtitle">Step 3. Receive Command</span><BR><P>
* Inside the `On WiFi Received`, put a nested `if-else` statement with different conditions
* Set the first condition as `WAN_Command = Red`
* In the `if` segment, perform the change color action by `strip show color red` 
* In the next `if` condition, use `WAN_Command = Orange`
* Set the color to Orange by `strip show color orange`
* Repeat the previous steps, with changes on the Color, to finish the setup of responding to each color.

## IoT (App inventor 2)
<HR>

<span id="subtitle">Step 1. Create an APP project<BR><P>

* Create a APP inventor account at [http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/)
* Create a new project

![auto_fit](images/Case12/Case12_p4.png)<P>

<span id="subtitle">Step 2. Design the layout of APP<BR><P>

* In the designer page, pull the layout element from the left side to the editor 

![pic_70](images/Case12/Case12_p5.png)<P>

* In this example case, using different `button`, `textbox`, `label` and `layout control`
* Place the element in your way
* For each element has their own property, you may change it in your mind, such as the `background color`, `font size`, `width`, `height`, `align`. <BR>In this example, you are required to change the `Text` to the <I><B>Color that button representing</B></I> to get the same result as documentation. For example, button who send "Red" command need to be "Red" as `Text`property
* Remember to put `Web` element to editor, it will used for sending command

![auto_fit](images/Case12/Case12_p6.png)<P>

<span id="subtitle">Step 3. Programming the elements in APP <BR><P>

* Switch to Blocks page by click the button at top right corner

![pic_50](images/Case12/Case12_p7.png)

* According to the catalog of function needs, find it at the left side and put to editor
* Go to `buttonX` element, find the `when buttonX.Click do` function, put it to editor ( X represent the number of button)
* Go to `Web1` element, find the `set Web1.URL to`, put it inside to the `when buttonX.Click do`
* Go to `Text` catalog, find the `join` and `" "` element to start build the control API
* Control API is: `https://control.smarthon.cc/publish?id=ID&msg=MSG` , while `ID` and `MSG` means `IoT:bit ID` and `Command` respectively 
* The program need to replace the `ID` and `MSG` according to different IoT:Bit and command in the API
* Use `TextBox1.Text` to get the `ID` input from user
* You may hard code the `MSG` with text command
* But, you can also use `ButtonX.Text` to get the `Text` property of button, which can used as the `MSG` in the example case, be careful you need to set up the `Text` property before you do that 
* Use `join` properly to concatenate the API from each parts
* After complete the API URL, use `call Web1.Get` from `Web1` to send the API Command

For example<P>

![auto_fit](images/Case12/Case12_p8.png)<P>

* After finish the function for `button1`, repeat the steps for other buttons, with changes on target button element ( from `button1` to `button2`, `button3`, ... )

## Result
<HR>
After sending color messages from APPs, the color of light will change.<BR><P>

![auto_fit](images/Case12/Case12_result.gif)<P>

## Think
<HR>

1. Can you think of a suggestion to make the colorful light even smarter?<BR>
(e.g. add automatic decision rather than always wait for command)<P>
2. Can you try to add some buttons on the app for more complex action?
