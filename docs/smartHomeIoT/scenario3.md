* Put a if statement in the When Button at P2 pressed block.  
* Set the condition to door\_unlock \= true.  
* When door\_unlock \= true, that's means it is unlock successfully, the servo should open the door by Turn 180 servo to 180 degree at P7, after that, wait for 2 second by pause (ms) 5000, then close and lock the door again by Turn 180 servo to 65 degree at P6 and set variable door\_unlock to false.  
    
![pic_60](./images/Sc3/Sc3_p5.png)
<p>

**Step 3\. Set the password input method**

* Snap on button A pressed to editor.  
* Use change btnA by 1 to increase the count variable by 1\.  
* Repeat the step with minor differences on target to let button B also can increase btnB.  
     
![pic_60](./images/Sc3/Sc3_p6.png)
<p>

**Step 4\. password input method**

* Snap on button A+B pressed to editor.  
* Put an if-else statement inside.  
* Use btnA \= 2 and btnB \= 3 as conditions, you may also change it to your favourite password.  
* In the if segment, that means the input is correct, set unlock to true to allow open the door when press the extended button.  
* In the else segment, that means the input is not correct, set unlock to false to deny open the door when press the extended button.  
* Reset the two count variable btnA and btnB to 0 for next input.
