### Part 1: Setting up the Car speed monitoring (Case 5 Revised)

<span id="subtitle">1.1 Hardware Connect</span><p>

* Connect the Distance Sensor to P14 (trig)/ P15 (echo) port of IoT:bit.
* Extend the connection of OLED to the I2C connection port of IoT:bit.

<p>

<span id="subtitle"> 1.2 Programming (MakeCode)</span><p>

**Step 1. Initialize OLED screen**

* Drag Initialize OLED with width:128, height: 64 to on start.
* Set distance1, distance2 and speed to 0 from variables.


![pic_40](./images/Sc3/Sc3_p1.png)
<p>

**Step 2. Set up function (calculate_Speed)**

* Set up a new function calculate_Speed from Advanced > Functions.
* Set distance1 to get distance unit cm trig P14 echo P15 (distance from the car to the distance sensor before 1 second) Drag Pause to wait 1000ms and set distance2 to get distance unit cm trig P14 echo P15 (distance from the car to the distance sensor after 1 second).
* By the equation of speed = distance / time. We get the speed of the moving car to (distance1-distance2)/1 (unit: cm/s).

![pic_60](./images/Sc3/Sc3_p2.png)<p>

**Step 3. Calculate car speed**

* In block forever, call function calculate_Speed from Advanced > Functions to get the speed of the moving car.
* Snap If statement into the loop.
* Plot bar graph of … from Led and draw variable speed into the plotted value. Set value up to 20.
* In if speed ≥0, snap clear OLED display from OLED to avoid overlap.
* Snap show string and show value of variables distance1, distance2 and speed.
