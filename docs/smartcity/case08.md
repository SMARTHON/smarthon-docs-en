## Sender
<HR>

### Goal
<HR>

Make a sender to send signal to another micro:bit to show if there is traffic jam or not.<BR><P>

### Background
<HR>

<span id="subtitle">How to send signal to another micro:bit?</span><P>
Micro:bit (sender and receiver) are connected to the same channel so wifi message can be sent between the micro:bit. Such that when the sender micro:bit sends a Wi-Fi message “trafficjam” to receiver micro:bit. When receiver micro:bit receives a WiFi message “trafficjam”, the connected traffic light will turn red.<BR><P>

<span id="subtitle">Sender micro:bit operation</span><P>
When the light value detected is too low, this would represent there is a traffic jam and and a ‘trafficjam’ wifi message to another microbit. When the light value detected is high, this would represent there is no traffic jam and send a “nojam” wifi message to another micro:bit.<BR><P>

* Set `variable2` to `light value from light sensor at P0`
* Snap `clear OLED display` from `OLED` to avoid overlap
* Snap `show string` and show value of variables `light2`

<span id="subtitle">Step 4. Send notification when someone pass by</span><P>
* Snap `if statement` 
* Set `light` < `10` in to if-condition (traffic jam is detected)
* Snap `WiFi Sender send channel… message…` from `IoT:bit` > `channel`
* Set channel to `tsuenwan`, message `trafficjam`
* Set `else-condition` (traffic jam is not detected)
* Snap `WiFi Sender send channel… message…` from `IoT:bit` > `channel`
* Set channel to `tsuenwan`, message `nojam`

### Result
<HR>

Light sensor is used to detect if there are traffic jam. Once the light intensity is not low, it indicates that there is a traffic jam on the road. Wi-Fi message “nojam” will be sent to another micro:bit (receiver).<BR><P>

Q1. How can we use distance sensor to detect traffic status?<BR><P>


## Receiver
<HR>

### Goal
<HR>

Make an auto-traffic LED Module by receiving signal from sender micro:bit.<BR><P>

### Background

<span id="subtitle">How to receive signal from another micro:bit?</span><P>
Micro:bit (sender and receiver) are connected to the same channel so wifi message can be sent between the micro:bit. If receiver micro:bit receives a WiFi message “trafficjam” from sender, the connected traffic light will turn red.<BR><P>

<span id="subtitle">Receiver micro:bit operation</span><P>
When a wifi message “trafficjam” is received, it means there is traffic jam forward. The traffic LED Module will turn red. When a wifi message “nojam” is received, it means there is no traffic jam forward. The traffic LED Module will turn green. By using smart traffic light, the problem of traffic jam can be reduced as automatic traffic control is used.<BR><P>

### Result
<HR>

By receiving wifi message, traffic LED Module will turn to the corresponding colour automatically.
If there are no traffic jam ahead (detected by light sensor). Micro:bit (sender) will send wifi message “nojam” to the micro:bit (receiver). The traffic light will turn green.
