# Chapter 5: Object to Object communication

In this example, micro:bit (sender and receiver) are connected to a channel called “chatroom”.<BR><P>
Peter want to send a smile message to Sally via internet (WAN). Peter’s micro:bit will send a Wi-Fi message “smile” to Sally’s micro:bit. When Sally receive a WiFi message smile, her micro:bit LED will show a smile icon.<BR><P>

<span id="remarks">*Before we control the micro:bit, please make sure your micro:bit is connected to the Wi-Fi.</span><BR><P>



 
## Receiver side
<HR>

<span id="subtitle">Goal:</span><P>
The receiver joins the channel, set the corresponding action when message received.


<span id="subtitle">Step 1: Connect Wi-Fi</span><BR><P>
Before we join the channel, we need to connect to the network first. We have already known how to connect to the Wi-Fi on the first chapter.<P>
![auto_fit](images/Ch5/Ch5_p1.png)<P>

<span id="subtitle">Step 2: Join the channel</span><BR><P>
We can let the Micro:bit listening on specific channel to receive the command<BR>
* Snap the `on button A+B pressed` to stage
* Put the `WiFi Receiver join channel` to the `on button A+B pressed`
* Type the name of the channel “Chatroom”

*<B>The user can join more than 1 channel, the maximum is 4.</B>


<span id="subtitle">Step 3: Set the corresponding action</span><BR><P>
After press the A and B button at the same time, Micro:bit will start listening on channel “chatroom” to wait other people send message to it. We need to use the `On WiFi Receiver received` to read the command and take action.<P>

* Snap `On WiFi Receiver received` to stage
* If need to received include value message, can use the <b>include value version</b> `On WiFi Receiver received` at the same time 
* Do the `if-condition statement` to the variable `receivedMessage`
* When the `receivedMessage` called “smile”, the LED will show a smile icon; 
* When the `receivedMessage` not called “smile”, the LED will show a sad icon.

<span id="subtitle">1. Check channel joined status</span><P>

When the Receiver was joined the channel, it can check the listening was started successfully or not. The `On WiFi channel joined` will provide the `Error_code` for you to determine the result.
* Go to the OLED Tab
* Snap `initialize OLED …` to `on Start`
* Snap the `On WiFi channel joined` to stage
* Use `show string` to show the `Error_code` with `channel` name

If `Error_code` is 0, means no error occur<BR>
If `Error_code` is not 0, means error occur<BR>
Normally, if no internet connection or the Channel Server is down, the code will be -28674<P>
